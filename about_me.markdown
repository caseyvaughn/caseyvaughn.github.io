I'm a full-stack developer with a background in international relations and program coordination. Originally from Indiana (go Hoosiers!), my passion for language learning and exploration led me to live & study in Chile, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Washington DC. I now proudly call Philadelphia my home.

My curiousity to understand how the technology we use everyday works led me to learn web development. Iâ€™m most fulfilled when collaborating with others to make a positive impact on the world.

Outside of coding, I'm an avid cyclist and birder.

My cat Juni is my most frequent pair-programming partner.
