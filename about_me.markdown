👩🏼‍💻 I'm a full-stack developer with a background in international relations and program management. My curiosity to understand how the technology we use everyday works led me to learn web development.

🌏I’m most fulfilled when collaborating with others to make a positive impact on the world. I'm currently contributing to open source projects with Ruby for Good.

🇨🇱🇹🇷🇦🇿Originally from Indiana (go Hoosiers!), my passion for language learning and exploration led me to live & study in Chile, Spain, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Washington DC. I now proudly call Philadelphia my home, where I'm working on keeping my Spanish and Turkish.

🚲🦜 I'm an avid cyclist and birder. My favorite cycling adventure was solo bike touring across northern Spain.

🐈 💻 My cat Juni is my most frequent pair-programming partner.
